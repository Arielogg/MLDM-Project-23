# MLDM Project 2023

## Overview

Welcome to the MLDM Project repository. This project is part of the Master's program in Machine Learning and Data Mining at Jean Monnet University. Our team is focused on exploring the utilization of the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) algorithm to find partial differential equations (PDEs) from sets of unregistered microscopy images of surfaces exhibiting self-arranging patterns upon stimulation.

## Project Description

The primary challenge addressed in this project is the identification of governing PDEs from unregistered electron microscopy images. These images exhibit patterns similar to those produced by the 2D Swift-Hohenberg equation. Our approach involves two main steps:

1. **Image Registration:** We apply various image registration methods to align the unregistered electron microscopy images. This is a crucial preprocessing step to ensure the accuracy of subsequent analyses.
2. **PDE Identification:** After registration, we use the SINDy algorithm and its variant, SINDyCP, to identify the governing PDEs from the processed images.
